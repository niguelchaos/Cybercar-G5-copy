### How do we plan to collaborate?

- Mainly following Scrum methodology:
   - Project will be organized in 1 week Sprints.
   - Product backlog will contain an overview of what the product's functionalities are, and will be a place to discuss and plan our sprints around.
   - Tasks for each sprint will be defined in sprint boards, on Trello.
   - Large tasks will be broken down into smaller pieces/tasks.
   - Scrummaster - helps make sure we are following defined practices and members are doing their jobs.
   - Daily standups on slack, and if we are having physical meetings, then stand up in a meeting. Weekends not included.
   - Everybody should be present in Planning and Retrospective as they are important to the collaboration. Team should be notified with at least one day in advance if unable to attend important meetings/reviews.

- Kanban Practices to be used:
   - Boards on Trello will represent sprints and each task as cards.
   - During work the tasks will be pulled by members from the sprint backlog and will move from: [To Do], [Doing], [Needs Reviewing], and [Done].
      - In order for a task to be moved to Done, the feature/task must be integrated in the master branch.
      - In order for a feature to be merged with master, a pull request will have to be made. At least one other member will have to review it, and accept or reject the feature in order to merge tasks into the master branch.
      - GitLab will be used as a way of version control for the source code.
      - The master branch should be always up to date and have the latest version
      - After a branch is merged, delete the feature branch.
      - Feature branches should be named after what the task/feature is about.
   ---
- Other Guidelines
  - Contribute to documentation early, alongside development.
  - Write readable code (do not use unclear abbreviations for variable names (ex. wl for wheel).
  - If abbreviations are used, they should be standardized and / or commented.
  - Physical group meetings should not last longer then 18:00 PM.

### What is our intended way of communication within our group?

- Face to face communication and physical meeting.
- Slack for the rest (internet based).

---

### How will we resolve conflicts?

- Talk about it as soon as possible - do not wait.
- Sprint retrospectives can be a good possibility to discuss about conflicts (for example, why a person is not doing their task
- Make compromises to satisfy both parties
- If compromises don't work, ask for TA help.
